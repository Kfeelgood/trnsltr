# trnsltr

A simple tool that connects to your GitHub repo, fetches all `.yml` files from `config/locales`, puts them into a table for editing, and commits them back to master when you're done.

EARLY PROTOTYPE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

If anybody would like to steal this idea and turn it into a commercial app, please do. I would pay for that.
